## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Debugging the dynamic generation of game cards to ensure all data was displayed correctly
* Filtering the objects based on their keys and values for implementing features like "Show Funded Only" and "Show Unfunded Only" required careful design to avoid errors in logic and ensure accurate filtering results.
